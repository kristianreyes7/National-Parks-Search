National-Parks-Search

https://parks-list-from-nps.netlify.app/

Uses National Park Services API to render data on site.  User has the option to input a two letter state code and the site will return a current list of all national parks within their area.  

In addition to the list of parks, user may also find information about entrance fees, hours, weather conditions, directions, and typical hours.  The user interface is interchangeable between mobile and desktop and when a modal appears they may also click anywhere on the site to close it.    

All images used for national park cards are provided by the API and a link to the park is also provided.
